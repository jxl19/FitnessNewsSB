# FitnessNews

## Project Description
Fitness Newsletter will be a web application that a user can sign up to and read up on the most recent fitness newsletters. Newsletters will be managed by administrators that can create new newsletters. After creation of a newsletter, a copy of the newsletter will be stored in pdf format in the cloud. The newsletters can also be updated if there are errors. Users can sign up for this service and they can choose to receive email notifications whenever there are new newsletters posted. They can also just visit the website to check for new fitness newsletters. While logged in, they can see previous newsletters if they want to. From the newsletters a user is currently viewing, they have the option to download it as a pdf so they can keep it with then. They can also use the website to update information such as their name, password, and if they want a subscription to receive email. If they want to stop their subscription to receive email about new newsletters, users can update that as well.
